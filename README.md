Abstract

SmartBill - A Secure, Paperless Billing Platform

Businesses continue to depend on printed receipts for nearly every transaction, a habit that contributes to environmental waste, increases operational costs, and limits how efficiently records can be stored or shared. Although digital receipts have emerged as an alternative, their adoption remains slow because customers are often unwilling to share personal contact details for privacy reasons. This tension between sustainable business practices and data protection highlights the need for a modern billing approach that respects both concerns.

SmartBill proposes a web-based solution that eliminates paper dependency while preserving user choice. Each transaction automatically generates a secure digital bill that can be accessed through a QR code or a short transaction link no personal data required. Customers who prefer traditional communication can still opt for printed copies or email delivery. Behind the interface, a robust Node.js and MongoDB architecture ensures encryption, access control, and reliable data management.

The project envisions a billing system that is fast, environmentally responsible, and privacy conscious. By blending sustainability with convenience, SmartBill aims to redefine everyday purchase experiences and inspire a shift toward smarter, greener digital transactions.
